#### Overview

SyriaTel is a mobile network provider in Syria. This project aims to provide insights into the determinant factors of churning as well as predict future cases of churn using different models in order to provide adequate recommendations to the company. This would in turn help to retain customers / product consumers who would otherwise churn.

This would help improve the health of the business while assisting in the forecasting of future revenue for the business. Building a classifier to predict whether a customer will ("soon") stop doing business with SyriaTel, would then provide information on patterns that may exist and shed light on the problem.

#### Business and Data Understanding

The project uses [SyriaTel Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset) dataset from kaggle. The dataset is going to be used to determine features that are likely very related to the possibility of users to stop or cancel using the services of SyriaTel comunications. In examining these features, it is possible to identify these features and use them to predict future churn possibilities.

The dataset contains 3,333 rows and 21 columns. The columns contain features associated with call information such as number of minutes for calls, time of day the calls were made, the type of call, that is, international of to customer service etcetra. The target feature is the churn in the churn column which shows which consumers stopped using the services as well as which consumers continued using the service. The dataset is also imbalanced as will be seen later and this will need to be addressed as well

>>> * From the above cells we can see that the dataset, there are no null values. This can be seen by the constant count in the description as well as non-null counts in the information about the dataset but this is confirmed in the next section.
>>>
>>
>>> * It also identifies 1 boolean column, 8 float and 8 integer columns and finally 4 object type columns. This means that there will be need to convert 5 columns for use including the target feature column.

#### Modeling

The models used were this and that with the results as this and that

#### **Evaluation**

We use this and this model and this model had the best performance when compared to the rest as well as this results.

It had a score of (x) when scoring using precision, recall, f1 score, accuracy as well as roc/auc, $r^2$ etc

We can also observe that this other model does poorly because of this and that eg the assumptions or the hyper-parameters etc

The visualization of x and y showed A and B relationship between them

The variable results mean X and Y

#### Conclusion

From the various models used we see that this was the best performing model for this and that reason and explained this and that with this and that result that can be used by the company in order to bring about retention of customers

The best preforming model is this and has this advantages that would help in doing this and that
