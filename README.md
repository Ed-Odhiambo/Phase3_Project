#### Overview

Most naturally, your audience here would be the telecom business itself, interested in reducing how much money is lost because of customers who don't stick around very long. The question you can ask is: are there any predictable patterns here?

Here we can say that the main aim of the project is to try to determine the churn rate for future customers and find a way to minimize it

#### Business and Data Understanding

The chosen dataset is (df)

How is it distributed and how can it be showcased / visualized
The data has (x) number of rows and (y) number of columns. From the columns, (x) can be seen and (y) can be observed etc.
The chosen dataset is (df)

What do the stakeholders want?

What is a brief explanation of the data or lengthy

#### Modeling

The models used were this and that with the results as this and that

#### **Evaluation**

We use this and this model and this model had the best performance when compared to the rest as well as this results.

It had a score of (x) when scoring using precision, recall, f1 score, accuracy as well as roc/auc, $r^2$ etc

We can also observe that this other model does poorly because of this and that eg the assumptions or the hyper-parameters etc

The visualization of x and y showed A and B relationship between them

The variable results mean X and Y

#### Conclusion

From the various models used we see that this was the best performing model for this and that reason and explained this and that with this and that result that can be used by the company in order to bring about retention of customers

The best preforming model is this and has this advantages that would help in doing this and that
